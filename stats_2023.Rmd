```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

###Set up data (Same as previously done)
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(scales)
#set key attributes####
x = 4326 #crs for first spatial df
y = 4326 #crs for second spatial df
z = 20 #set buffer is using a join to point data SET FOR 20M
#data, read in, set as sf, list projection####
shrubs <- read_csv("shrubs.csv") %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords=c("long","lat"), crs = x, remove=FALSE) %>% 
  st_transform(32610) #crs = 32610 is UTM and will return distances in meters
animals <- read_csv("tidy.csv") %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords=c("long","lat"), crs = y, remove=FALSE) %>% 
  st_transform(32610) #crs = 32610 is UTM and will return distances in meters
#create buffer for point data####
buffer <- st_buffer(animals, z) #decide on spatial scale
#spatially returns overlap instances within a buffer####
#returns a dataframe with only the positive co-occurrences
joined.xy <- st_intersection(buffer, shrubs)
#counts up multiple instances and generates new vector as counts by grouping factors####
joined.xy <- joined.xy %>% 
  group_by(uniID, lizard) %>% 
  summarize(n_shrubs = n()) %>% 
  st_drop_geometry
#rejoins to first object, ie the buffer and generates instances with no overlaps as zero####
tidy_all <- left_join(animals, joined.xy, by = "uniID") %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(n_shrubs = replace_na(n_shrubs, 0))
#QA/QC####
#check to ensure df dimensions and that zeros are reasonable
max(tidy_all$n_shrubs) #checks ecological viability
min(tidy_all$n_shrubs) #checks ecological viability
sum(tidy_all$n_shrubs) #checks positive co-occurrences
nrow(buffer) - nrow(tidy_all)
```
###Distinct only!
```{r}
tidy_distinct <- tidy_all %>%
  distinct() ###Does not change anything. Need to specify the lat long. See next area. 9307
```
###Distinct With Specifying Lat/Long
```{r}
tidy_distinct2 <- tidy_all %>%
  distinct(year, lat, long, .keep_all = TRUE) ###Outputs the same thing that we previously did! 4169

###4 decimal places
tidy_rounded <- tidy_all
tidy_rounded$rounded_lat <-  round(tidy_rounded$lat, digits = 4)
tidy_rounded$rounded_long <- round(tidy_rounded$long, digits = 4)

tidy_rounded <- tidy_rounded %>%
  distinct(year, rounded_lat, rounded_long, .keep_all = TRUE) ###Outputs the same as previous work! 4169 same as other line above


###3 decimal placed
tidy_rounded2 <- tidy_all
tidy_rounded2$rounded_lat <-  round(tidy_rounded2$lat, digits = 3)
tidy_rounded2$rounded_long <- round(tidy_rounded2$long, digits = 3)

tidy_rounded2 <- tidy_rounded2 %>%
  distinct(year, rounded_lat, rounded_long, .keep_all = TRUE) ###Outputs 1101 datapoints only.

###Do not want to do less than 3 digits because it is getting very general.
###I think 4 digits is our best bet for this!
```
